# Youtube Assiatant 

## Purpose of the app

The app was created as a learning project using langchain. 

## What is langchain? 

LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. It enables applications that:

Are context-aware: connect a language model to sources of context (prompt instructions, few shot examples, content to ground its response in, etc.)
Reason: rely on a language model to reason (about how to answer based on provided context, what actions to take, etc.)

The docs is located [here](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started)

This app will help you answer questions from a youtube video be it a podcast or a long video that you need some insights on. 
This is still work in progress and it has been tested with mainly podcasts. Asking it to summarize what was said
about a certain area in a video. 

For example in this [podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qJphZ1Zajw). One can ask 
about What do they say about playing overseas
